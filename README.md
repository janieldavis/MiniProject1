Mini-Project 1: Notes and References

Janie Davis

National Bridge Inventory (NBI) data for 2022 and 2023 downloaded as zip files here: https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/ascii.cfm

Recording and Coding Guide for the Structure Inventory and Appraisal of the Nationâ€™s Bridges: https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/mtguide.pdf

I referred to the following study to choose the predicting factors to use in my model: Characterizing Bridge And Culvert Deterioration In Arizona Using National Bridge Inventory Data by Vaishnavi Kandgule https://www.proquest.com/docview/2908197223?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses
I also used bridge age, which was not considered in this study.

I used our In-Class Assignment 1 to source the code for the operations we have done before in class. I used ChatGPT to develop the codes for the operations we have not done in class.

Aalok helped me work out the codes that converted the latitude and longitude entries from 8- or 9- character strings to degree/minute/second coordinates, and then from those to decimal degrees coordinates.
